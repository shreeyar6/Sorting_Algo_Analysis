# Sorting_Algo_Analysis
This repository contains the code, schematics, and reports for Analysis of Sorting Algorithms. The project focuses on implementing and analyzing three sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort) in Verilog. The algorithms are synthesized using 180nm technology and evaluated for power consumption and timing performance.
